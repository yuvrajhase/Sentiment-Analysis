# Sentiment Analysis

## About:
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using deep learning to predict the sentiment of text and emojis provided as input. By analyzing the sentiment score, we can gain insights such as the most frequently used words and the ratio of positive to negative sentiments in the input. The system utilizes the NLTK (Natural Language Processing Toolkit) for text processing and the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) algorithm for sentiment prediction. The dataset used for training and testing includes common movie reviews from the IMDB dataset.
